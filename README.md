# Hi, I'm Martins.

**Software Engineer | Java Ecosystem | Backend Systems**

I am a Software Engineer focused on building robust, scalable, and maintainable backend systems. My approach prioritizes **First Principles Thinking**—understanding the fundamental constraints of memory, CPU, and I/O—over transient frameworks.

I specialize in the intersection of High-Performance Java and Linux Infrastructure.

### 📐 Engineering Approach

My work is guided by specific engineering tenets:

* **Complexity Management:** Solving business problems with the simplest possible technical solution.
* **Infrastructure Awareness:** Writing code that understands the OS it runs on (Linux/JVM interaction).
* **Defensive Programming:** Designing systems that fail gracefully and predictably.

### 🔬 Current Technical Focus

I am currently conducting deep-dive implementation and research in:

* **Linux Internals:** Systemd service orchestration and Kernel resource management.
* **JVM Architecture:** Memory models, Garbage Collection tuning, and bytecode behavior.
* **Algorithmic Efficiency:** Implementation of high-performance logic using core Java.
